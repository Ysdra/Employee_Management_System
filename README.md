## App Description:
This is a node.js application that allows users to change and edit employees' information without having to know MySQL commands in order to do so. 

## Methodology:
This node.js app relies on 3 key node packages: inquirer, mySQL, and console.table. With these 3 packages combined, we are able to dynamically render a table displaying different employee information in our git bash terminal to allow users to input changes to a MySQL database without having to open MySQL Workbench to make changes.
